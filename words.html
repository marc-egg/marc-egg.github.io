<p>
ive
<br><br>
i often see 
<br>
homeless people  talking  
<br>
to themselves 
<br>
to nobody that would care to listen 
<br>
not just  talking  
<br>
-proselytizing-
<br>
 i  think      
<br>
how noble of spirit of them
<br>
 to be speaking directly  from the 
<br>
Source 
<br>
 to the audience of one's  
<br><br>
Self<br><br>  having

 no expectations of resolving the dilemma and
<br>
   going through the script  
<br><br>
 anyway 
 <br>
 i ask myself should i stop and listen 
 <br>
 but on my bike and its fucking minus twenty  
 <br>
 and i dont really listen 
 <br>
 to the sound of nothing 
 <br>
 anymore 
<br>
 even if its coming in the form
 <br>
  of the eternal ramblings 
<br>
 of an old man 
 <br>
  maybe next time pal
 <br><br>
 .  in the last year 
<br>
 ive 
 <br>
 had the pleasure to encounter 
 <br>
 many fine pairs  
<br><br>
 of abandoned children's footwear 
 <br>
 i hope and plan to plant them 
 <br>
 somewhere as seeds 
 <br>
 of anarchy  
 <br>
 <br>
 everything that is mine
 <br>
  is yours
 <br>
  they say it could be a top 5 snowstorm 
<br>
 or a rock
 <br>
  put some pictures of the streets
 <br>
  dammit
 <br>
 <br>
   i remember i played a lot of golden eye 
 <br>
 during the ice storm 
 <br>
 i guess thats what you do 
 <br>
 when you're homeless
 <br>
  and staying with regular programming  
 <br>
 <br>
 shit 
 <br>
 this is becoming some thing 
 <br>
 more akin to recordings from a broken 
 <br>
 conversation<br>
 <br>
  than a poem<br><br>
   well
 <br>
  i dont care, either
<br><br>
<br><br>
>>>>>>>>>
<br><br>
<br><br>
Friend, dearest,
<br><br>
i
 <br>
i feel that 
<br>
i AM 
<br>
you
<br> 
you and  
<br>
i the same breath 
<br>
i the same person-mind 
<br><br>
 it is a feeling both strange end wonderful 
<br>
and also blind 
<br>
 is truth that sees well but does not touch itself, in the heart 
<br>
that we are one and the same 
<br>
kind may be or maybe not,
<br> 
what remains remains to be seen 
<br>
as keen as i am on seeing eye to eye and whisper mouth to mouth 
<br>
to ear to ear
<br>
 and between what is and what is not mine is full of doubt  
<br><br>
i feel you because i am going to eat you
<br>
 (and i need to make sure you are good)
<br>
 because as i enter wood would you please expand
<br>
 and who is inside who
<br>
  is inside who absolutely absolutely 
<br>
irrelevant 
<br>
who is inside must be the eternally asked 
<br>
absurdly over-done 
<br>
(did it?)
<br>
 question, that is because difference there is none be-
<br>
 tween the two: Inside and Out
<br>
<br>
and inside-out
<br>
 i feel sometimes when skin sinks beneath the sickness 
<br>
 that the body once was considered (evil to be, how!) 
<br>
that
<br>
 if somebody out there is food for someone else  
<br>
else survival wouldn't be survival of the fittest
<br>
 but rather 
<br>
something closer to dolce vita sweetness luxury good health, 
<br>
my body still would give itself to become another's
<br>
 a mother’s perhaps, the violent embrace of lovers
<br>
 still would fill the space of babies unborn, yet undiscovered would be 
<br>
what i hold dear, in secret
<br>
: the me, the eye that is my i, 
<br>
 the power of saying this is my _____, my_____, (this, that)  
<br>
<br>
oh tooth fairy, give me all treats 
<br>
or a little death if you like 
<br>
quite fine-feeling as long as well nourished you are 
<br>
and
<br>
 i see (that you are)
<br>
 and feed myself on bodies washed
<br>
 - home - country - family
<br> 
- they are my clothes and
<br>
 underneath lies the me 
<br>
that is not me
<br> 
 the me that i don't consume
<br>  
the me that really is you.

<br><br><br><br>

<br><br>
<br><br>


i sat.
<br><br>
 I went for a bike ride, handstands, a few kicks 
<br>
GANJA. and the moment opens itself up(right and) center. 
<br>
i sat and i listened 
<br>
to the sound of me sitting in a room 
<br>
Listening. and the words come:<br>
 TOUCH. how you say what you want to say 
<br>
VOICE. who is this
<br>
NOW. always 
<br>
WONDER. i imagine the whole world made of 
<br>
HANDS symbol of power, and 
<br>
EYES the symbol of wisdom 
<br>
We rise, and the Garden lies before us
<br>
 WE stand still, and the Garden unfolds
<br>
 its work  (which is to awaken) 
<br>
i sat next to the cat.
<br>
 she let me tickle her between her paws a bit.
<br>
 i wrote this then i went on the internet.
<br><br>
<br><br>

================
<br><br>
<br><br>

internet love song.
<br><br>
 
i am following this, bliss path, the truth of smiles ripening soft bosoms with tickling insect jumping jacks, free-falling mountains of conundrum, candy horses rolling down paper-thin cycles of i'm awake! hunger, tiredness, acceptance, rebirth.
 <br><br>

i wish there was a radiant smiley face emoticon with a little tear of gratitude for you and you wish there was a little face with a tongue to lick it up
i bite the air wishing it was your shoulder. you: wispily running away with a cute flirty face pretending you could never want or enjoy that kind of pain
<br><br>
 
i am drowsily falling into an acro-yoga lovenest of golden eggs and musical moss and trippy honey pillows. i am tip for your top, pimp for thy squeek, tires for your slashes, mittens for your (i)lashes, ribbon for curtain, a stormy exit from your dysfunctional family supper, a tempest for your rowboat, a sail for your tempo, beaches for your shipwreck dreams, a melody in your heartbeat, cuddles near your fire-pit, i am riveting rambles that draw harping runny roses for your robust rustle, a voodoo milk-shake in your Caribbean vacation, a water-pump for your infinite Wilderness, a painted tea-pot Containing Our Collective Soul.
<br><br>
 
my love is a tingling bubbling powder that feeds tiny monsters guilty of hiding mysteries in our forgotten forests, an electro current of flesh and math and flowering antsy-pantsy, my love is the melting point of old books, the meeting of loose morals and bad habits, of mental hospitals and dew-drops, the dance of creation and maintenance and cataclysmic anger, Shiva and Kali negotiating their business in a rusty brooklyn diner. my love is finer than a quark, thicker than human stupidity, as cruel as a kitten, as lost as a partying emperor, graceful as the gait of a blind eagle.
<br><br>
 
my love is a failed artist. a brisk walk for a workaholic elder, a mixed-feelings whip in the hands of an unwilling executioner. my love is dim lighting in Beijing, a rave in the Arctic circle, a victim-less Venusian explosion. my love is a broken radio, a satellite in your kitchen, a gummy bear in your parent's couch. my love is a lucky penny in an infant stomach, roadkill on a bicycle path, straight A's in kindergarten, an impeccable fountain of frustration and complaints. my love is a chocolate and coffee stir-fry, a kiss-me-for-a-dollar sign in an abandoned warehouse, an earthquake in a wishing well, a bad joke at a funeral. my love is a 4 hour Hollywood commercial, Tom Cruise grovelling from Irritable Bowel Syndrome, stealing heroin from Kurt Cobain. my love is a nice ass in Winnie the poo. my love is justice served steaming hot, fresh out of the microwave, with a side of Russian mustard and an Umbilical chord. my love is a parade of miniature dinosaurs, a Hawaiian Cowboy Space Police Teddy Bear. my love is Old man, rocking chair, smelly dog, tobacco, Bourbon, and porn in the background. my love is a Japanese Wife Who Is Excellent at Accounting. my love is prehistoric science-fiction. my love is a dull knife buried under the chin of political aspirations, a stab in the face of indecency, a slap on the wrist by a hyena with a tuxedo. my love is a birthday party for a dead viking in Valhalla. my love is a poem that never ends, lips that never dry, a post-card from a sorcerer, a plastic cup on the other side of World War III. my love is Isis, coming out of the closet, whispering "I am that I am", admiring a photo-shopped panorama of the Middle East with a glass of orange juice. my love is a blend of a discontinued flavor of Fruity Loops, McDonald's special sauce, caviar and curry paste. my love is an open mike that should've been over hours ago and the bartender is sleeping.

<br><br>
<br><br>

================
<br><br>
<br><br>

(loss)
<br><br>
earlier in the day
<br>
a storm was brewing
<br>
grey clouds shooed the sun's light into
<br>
alleyways, afternoon naps and heavy suppers
<br><br>
I walked to the picnic table and back
<br>
Smoking, unconsciously.
<br>
I could hear the crackling of a heart or two
<br>
seeking safety from the Winds
<br>
of despair and forgetfulness
<br><br>

When the Moon appeared
<br>
it whispered:
<br>
"Remember This Song? 
<br>
We wrote it together.."
<br><br>

by this time, the world had endured
<br>
[enough of] a beating
<br><br>

I could smell the settling down
<br>
of everything
<br>
that Had Been Brought Up,
<br>
the fresh sense of renewal
<br>
of a Silence awaiting to be tasted
<br><br>

I thanked the celestial goddess
<br>
for the friendly reminder
<br>
Acknowledged the sweetness of the air
<br>
now docile and warm and almost
<br>
Welcoming
<br><br>
<br>
In the distance a young couple retreated
<br>
to rest.
<br>
I sat outside
<br>
admiring the undisturbed and majestic emptiness
<br>
and gentle beauty
<br>
of the Night Sky
<br><br>
<br><br>
====++++=====
<br><br>
<br><br>
You Are a Garden
<br><br>

As i me
<br>
and
<br>
er
<br>
through the afternoon haze of nice
<br>
shower, cherry-picking tomatoes, admirable beat!
<br>
weed and sweet jungle juicy greens
<br>
i ask myself 
<br>
when did i forget to slow down?
<br>
what is with this rush to see and do?
<br>
and a
<br>
void..
<br>
i might as well
<br>
rest
<br>
and tickle
<br>
a tumbleweed pickle sprout before 
<br>
he disappears into
<br>
his secret meditation
<br><br>

Being in this place fills me with Questions
<br>
and Presence and
<br>
reminds me 
<br>
i already have everything
<br><br>

Sometimes i wonder
<br>
how can i be so confident when all i have to show for is That
<br>
which cannot be shown or proven or demonstrated
<br>
is it enough
<br>
and is it crazy to think that when entering back into My garden
<br>
that all i want to do
<br>
is to meet you
<br>
there?
<br>
(seeds of mystery sprung about the silent soil of inner life,
<br>
the harvest of a soft caressing Winter envelope of Thought)
<br><br>
<br><br>
----------------
<br>
<br><br><br>
In the Cold metal cell of invisible soul, the ocean of pre-birth and after-life, of future unknown
<br>
and unknowable, the first recognition. visions of millennia, eggdimensional hyper-worlds 
<br>
developing within. idea fish water grass muscle tissue bacterium structure, all is submerged in 
<br>
bubble, all is thick, vacuous, milky, raw. light flickers, barely entering the retina, it struggles and 
<br>
dies and struggles; the first forms of life, appearing, like extra layers of darkness, darkness enveloping itself like brain, slowly growing, breaking into new space, pushing the outer shell, spilling out fizzz. suddenly, the opening fire of a hundred hunters killing, rivers of blood cutting through rock, history, frozen time. rain starts gushing, fuming, mad rain, penetrates the abdomen of defeated soil, and then, a soft swelling of the earth, endlessly giving, stomach burst, vegetation.   
<br><br>

the invention of peace.

they know that they know
<br>

<br>
than

being
<br>
the ones that know not that they know not.
<br><br>
 
the fools
<br>
the suckers long for
<br>
the dream

the exhaust pipe, a wet Whisky ladder, a slip slide down the ash fault
<br><br>

<br>
arms racing with fire
<br>
the monsters approaching and your inner self smiling
<br><br>

blind celestial illusion
<br><br>

<br>

<br>
 and poof. within the blink of an eye

<br>
they lie in their nice
<br>
warm. cozy death.
<br>
they breathe death in and death out
<br>
and they Give. the best. the most.
<br><br>
 
the givers are silent.
<br><br>
 
they wait until the last moment and hush you into a meadow with a kiss
<br>
and eavesdrop
<br><br>
 
to be a true giver one must first bask in one's own loneliness.
<br>
 piss and dust.
<br><br>
 
and this promise from the universe:
<br>
i am going to be kicking around for a while
<br>
 and you Never know.
<br><br>
 
the suckers smile
<br>
because its fucking great.
<br>
they're "winning!"
<br><br>
 
and its never going to stop.
<br>
it feeds itself.
 
<br><br>
and the givers wait, silently just until the last moment.
<br>
and take you away.
